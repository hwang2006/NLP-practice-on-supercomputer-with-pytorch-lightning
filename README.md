Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate natural language in a way that is similar to how humans do. NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks including sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, chatbots and virtual assistants, question answering and name entity recognition.
